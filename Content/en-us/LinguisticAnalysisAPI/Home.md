# Linguistic Analysis APIs Overview

Welcome to the Linguistic Analysis APIs.
These APIs provide access to natural language processing (NLP) tools that identify the structure of text.
The current release provides three types of analysis:

 - [Sentence separation and tokenization](Sentences-and-Tokens.md)
 - [Part-of-speech tagging](POS-tagging.md)
 - [Constituency parsing](Constituency-Parsing.md)

## Getting Started

First you can familiar with the major types of analysis listed above.
Next, look into the APIs for [getting the list of available analyzers](AnalyzersMethod.md) and how they are [named](Analyzer-Names.md).
Finally, look into the API for [analyzing new input](AnalyzeMethod.md).
